# 121AngularMockDataserveice

This project includes code for the exxamples in Week 12 of CSCI E31. This is Angular 19, and uses 'standalone' components (no app.module.ts required). This example includes the mock data service for development purposes. Using mock data allows you to build out the mechanics of the data service class without having to deal with the HTTP part, just yet.
