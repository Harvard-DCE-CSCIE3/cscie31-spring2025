# 131AngularDataServiceForms
This project includes code for the exxamples in Week 13 of CSCI E31. This is Angular 19, and uses 'standalone' components (no app.module.ts required). 

This example implements all four CRUD operations and uses Angular forms.  The http requests are set to point to the class photo galllery application. To test with your own data, you'll need to start your Express REST API project (homework #5) and set the URL in environment.ts to point to your localhost REST API URL.
